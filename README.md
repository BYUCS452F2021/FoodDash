# FoodDash

A software that allows you to order food from local restaurants directly to your house. 

You may be thinking to yourself that there are already many delivery services out there, so what is different about this one? The difference is that ours will not actually order this food or deliver it to your house!

Our plan is to allow users to:
1. Pick out the food items they want from a restaurant and create an order. 
2. Order the items (although, of course, never pay or receive any of the items).
3. Look through various restaurants to pick which one they would like to order from.

# Project Goals
Since this project is solely for this class, the main goal is to design and implement a great backend with logical decisions on how we model and store our data.

# Implementation Details
For our NoSQL Database, we are leaning towards using a document database (specifically MongoDB).

# Bolts
**Business**

Absolutely no intention to release this software to the public or generate any income from it. In theory though, it could be lucrative, but likely only if we provided it as a platform for restaurants to use for their own delivery services. 

**Operation**

The project will be entirely maintained by our group this semester. 

**Legal**

If any group members are interested in further developing this project to create a sellable product, he or she must notify all other group members and obtain permission/reach an agreement before using code contained in this repository.

**Technical**

Our priorities will be:
1. Design a logical and functional model of how we store and access data.
2. Implement our backend with chosen tech. 
3. Implement the MVP, focusing on allowing users to select the food to be delivered. 

**Social**

We would gain users by social media and influencer marketing.
